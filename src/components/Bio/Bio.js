                Professional freelance writer with a degree in Journalism and
                Communication from Paris 3 - Sorbonne Nouvelle University, Iâ€™ve
                been in this field for over 10 years.{' '}

                Although I first began as a PR, I rapidly switched to writing
                and copywriting. Back then, I also started getting more curious
                about other cultures, influenced by a travel expert, my mentor
                at the time.

                Later, while working for entertainment papers, I participated
                actively in pitching and creating two magazines, including a
                successful bimonthly with sparkly and quirky themes for young
                women. Late 2008, Japan LifeStyle was born. My responsibilities
                grew with the readership, and I went from copy editor to editor
                in chief. Those were six, sometimes challenging but always so
                unique, years.

                In 2016, after a year in South Korea, I decided to embrace the
                freelance road and to center on subjects I always enjoyed:
                travel, lifestyle, entertainment and IT.
              </p>
              <p>
                In my free time, I wrote and published three non-fiction books:
                one for a young audience and the other two focused on travel and
                lifestyle.

    );
  }
